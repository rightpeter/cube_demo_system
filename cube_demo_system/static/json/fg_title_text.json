At least 63 people have died and more than 600 are missing, officials say, while hundreds of thousands of others have been forced to flee their homes. Online, social media users have coordinated missing person appeals, organised assistance for the displaced and shared information. But in the scrabble for details, photographs of previous fires in California and elsewhere have been unwittingly muddled in with legitimate images of the ongoing fires. Here are some of the most widely-shared - and the real stories behind them. It's easy to see why this image struck such a chord. California firefighters of the Tehachapi Wildland Fire Crew 11 grab some well-earned sleep after an exhausting 24-hour shift. The photograph encapsulates the commitment and dedication of the emergency services. A single tweet of the image has attracted thousands of shares and tens of thousands of likes, in the context of the ongoing fires in California. Undoubtedly evocative, the image dates, however, from 2017 - and the California Thomas fire which was then the largest in the state's history. An area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined was burned. Michele Newell posted the image to Facebook on 19 December last year. Her son, Dylan, was among the resting firefighters. \"A little over two weeks ago Dylan texted me that Venture had a 100-acre fire,\" she wrote at the time. \"That fire erupted into something that took the homes of many friends and displaced hundreds of families. \"It's been heart-wrenching.\" Flames dwarf a trailer in the foreground as a fire in Malibu rages. Actor James Woods was among the social media users to share the image - but it actually dates from October 2007. According to the LA Times, close to 4,000 acres of land were burned and dozens of structures and vehicles destroyed when electricity pylons toppled over in high winds. Mr Woods has played a prominent role in coordinating help and assistance for fire victims online, through his use of the hashtags #SoCalFiresJamesWoods and #CampFireJamesWoods. The actor, who has developed a large online following in part through his vocal support of conservative causes, enlisted his 1.85 million Twitter followers in efforts to amplify missing person appeals, solicit donations and attract volunteers. It's been described as \"the most famous wildfire photograph ever taken\" and has been featured in Time magazine's year in pictures. But nonetheless, some social media users mistakenly attributed the fire to California in 2018. Thousands shared and liked posts featuring the image online. The photograph was taken in Sula, Montana, in 2000 by John McColgan, who worked with the Bureau of Land Management, Alaska Fire Service. Sparked by lightning strikes, the fire was one of 86 which raged across America's western states in August that year, according to Time.

For the grieving town, locating and identifying victims has become a top priority. With many of them likely burned beyond recognition, traditional DNA analysis techniques are inadequate, as they require samples to be shipped to a laboratory and take weeks to produce a DNA match. In addition, traditional tools sometimes fail when extreme heat damages tissue samples. As a consequence, the Butte County Sheriff's office hired a company specializing in Rapid DNA analysis, a technique primarily employed in war zones and crime scenes to generate results in about two hours. For the company, Colorado-based ANDE, it was the first time it would assist in the aftermath of a natural disaster since its founding in 2000. \"People have experienced so much loss and it's not over yet,\" said ANDE's chief communications officer, Annette Mattern. \"To be able to at least help some families know what the situation is will hopefully help in some small way.\" By Tuesday morning ANDE had set up a work site near Chico in Butte County, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. Chico, about 10 miles from Paradise, is the base for the search and firefighting operations. Coroner-led recovery teams, cadaver dogs and a National Guard contingent have been scouring debris from the Camp Fire, the deadliest in California's history, and turning over tissue and bone fragments to the ANDE team. The company designed its tools specifically to withstand war zone conditions and has worked extensively with the U.S. military. It has also helped law enforcement identify sexual assault suspects and the United Nations in child trafficking cases, Mattern said. Rapid DNA analysis has proven to be effective in identifying DNA from burned remains and bone fragments. In hopes of identifying remains as quickly as possible, ANDE has set up near Chico seven Rapid DNA analysis instruments, which operate like portable labs to chemically process and generate data on the DNA. Six employees were on site by Wednesday, and more were on the way, said the company's chief information officer, Stephen Meer. \"Certainly we are gearing up for higher capacity here,\" Meer said. Once the ANDE team finds a match between remains and DNA provided by a family member, the coroner's office is alerted so it can make an official pronouncement of death. Death certificates are required for families to settle matters as complicated as life insurance and estates and as basic as car titles, credit cards and bank accounts.

Real-time data and technology that were unavailable to property-casualty companies even a few years ago have shaped the industry's response to the Camp Fire, which has burned nearly 240 square miles (622 square kilometers) in northern California and the 151-square-mile (391-square-kilometer) Woolsey Fire in the Los Angeles area. By overlaying the data on maps marking its customers' locations, the company can quickly identify those who are likely to have been affected, said Jim Wucherpfennig, Travelers vice president of claims. \"That allows us to deploy people and resources where they are needed most,\" he said. The same data also can be used to determine risk and pricing for insurance in any given area, said Peter Kochenburger, the deputy director of the University of Connecticut's insurance law center. Insurers, for example, can use the telemetry to identify local vegetation, wind patterns and fire history. In some cases, it can determine that the owner of one home is more likely to suffer damage than the owner of a neighboring home, he said. \"Does it seem intrusive? It can be,\" he said. \"They have a lot more information on all of us, on our properties than they had two, five, 10 years ago. That's a major issue and that's something regulators are going to have to talk about.\" During the wildfires, Travelers said the information has been used to expedite claims, even in areas that are still inaccessible to inspectors. Workers were able to see what roads were open and map out spots in Chico and Thousand Oaks to park the RVs that serve as mobile claim centers, the company said. The tools also indicated where customers who evacuated were going to be, Wucherpfennig said. The glassed-in Travelers National Catastrophe Center is located in Windsor, Connecticut. Modeled after military war rooms, it includes a conference table behind 19 high-definition screens, which display maps, graphs, television images and social media sites, all providing real-time data on the fires. In some cases, even before adjusters arrive on scene, claims experts can assess damage from the fires and cut checks by using before-and-after images taken by drones, aircraft or satellites as well as videos or photos uploaded by customers from their phones. Employees have tools and smart phone apps that can convert those photos into instant measurements, to help quantify the damage. \"We're able to virtually interact with customers much more easily than we could even in the recent past,\" Wucherpfennig said. \"We're also able to monitor all forms of social media in real time. That helps us create an event footprint, which helps us understand how the event is tracking and what type of damages we're seeing.\"  ", {"Los Angeles": 2, "Butte": 1, "Ventura": 1, "Sonoma": 1}, [["Butte", 1], ["Los Angeles", 2]], [0.06563909, 0.02512296, 0.9092379]], ["../ca_wildfires/voa/VOA_NW_2018.11.23_4670707.txt", "2018.11.23", "California Fire Almost Completely Contained; Toll at 84", "Authorities in Northern California say the \u201cCamp Fire,\u201d which has killed 84 people since it began two weeks ago, is almost completely contained.

The massive wildfire that destroyed nearly 14,000 homes in the town of Paradise and surrounding communities was fully contained over the weekend after igniting more than two weeks ago.

In addition to people killed, three firefighters were injured, according to Cal Fire. The fire destroyed almost 14,000 homes, more than 500 businesses and about 4,300 other buildings. It burned about 153,000 acres.  By Sunday afternoon, officials couldn\u2019t account for 267 people, said Butte County Sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Miranda Bowersox. She said more than 500 people were searching burned areas to find remains or clues as to what happened to those who are still missing. Many of those missing are from Paradise, a town of about 27,000 people that was devastated by the fire. The heavy rains that hit California helped firefighters contain the flames, especially in hard-to-reach steep areas, according to Ms. Erickson. But the rains also raised concerns about possible flash flooding on the burned-over ground, according to the National Weather Service. California has been grappling with several severe fires in recent weeks, including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles, which started the same day as the Camp Fire.  The Woolsey Fire, which was contained Nov. 21, killed at least three people and forced the evacuation of about 295,000 others. It destroyed about 97,000 acres. Another risk now for fire-ravaged parts of the state: mudslides. The one-two punch of fire and mudslides is a common occurrence in California, where hills stripped of grass and other vegetation by flames in the fall are less able to soak up the winter rains that follow.  Last January, about a month after a rash of wildfires torched hillsides throughout Southern California, torrential rains prompted mass evacuations and, in some parts, devastating mudslides. In and around Montecito, in Santa Barbara County, at least 15 were killed and 25 injured in mudslides.  \u2014Jim Carlton contributed to this article.

Speaking to reporters before leaving Washington for Mississippi, Mr. Trump said of the report, \u201cI\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve read some of it. And it\u2019s fine.\u201d Asked if he agreed with the report\u2019s assessment of a large economic impact, he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d The U.S. National Climate Assessment, released Friday, said the measures U.S. communities and companies are undertaking to try to counteract the effects of rising temperatures have so far fallen short. The federal report concluded \u201cthat the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans\u2019 physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.\u201d Mr. Trump has long expressed skepticism of global-warming trends and has questioned the validity of climate science. He has also\u00a0sought to roll back federal rules designed to control greenhouse-gas emissions\u00a0amid a broader push to lessen regulatory burdens on companies.  In a visit last week to Malibu, Calif., to tour the devastation left by the state\u2019s most destructive wildfire, Mr. Trump was asked if visiting the site persuaded him that climate change was a problem that needed to be addressed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at everything,\u201d he replied, but suggested the problem was \u201cland management, and it\u2019s forest management.\u201d California legislators have said the state is seeking to improve its forest management but have criticized the Trump administration for not addressing climate change. On Monday, he said the U.S. was the \u201ccleanest we\u2019ve ever been\u201d but said the U.S.\u2019s actions were irrelevant if other countries\u2014\u201cChina and Japan and all of Asia\u201d\u2014didn\u2019t seek to improve their own efforts to combat climate change.\u00a0  In a separate federal report released Friday, researchers concluded that fossil-fuel emissions in North America have been declining steadily for the past decade because of a reduced reliance on coal, greater use of natural gas, and increased vehicle fuel-efficiency standards. As a result, North America\u2019s share of global carbon emissions dropped from 24% in 2004 to about 17% in 2013, said William Hohenstein,  director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Climate Change Program office. But global emissions overall continued to rise. The climate assessment report said global average temperature \u201cis rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing impacts.\u201d  Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com ", {"Los Angeles": 1}, [["Los Angeles", 1], ["Los Angeles", 1]], [0.06501474, 0.86823916, 0.06674606]], ["../ca_wildfires/wsj/WSJ_NW_2018.11.8_4.txt", "2018.11.8", "Wildfires Prompt Evacuation Orders in California", "Fast-moving wildfires erupted at both ends of California on Thursday, quickly engulfing tens of thousands of acres and prompting thousands of evacuations. In Southern California, a blaze in Ventura County between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara began in the afternoon and quickly grew to between 8,000 and 10,000 acres, fire officials said, prompting the area closure of U.S. Route 101. Called the Hill Fire, the blaze began just north of Thousand Oaks, the site of a deadly mass shooting at a bar Wednesday night. Just to the east, near Simi Valley, the Woolsey Fire, named after its canyon location, has burned 300 acres. In rural northern California, the Camp Fire, which began in the Feather River Canyon at about 6:30 a.m., quickly grew to 18,000 acres, as 40 mile-per-hour winds pushed it into small foothill communities. It has quickly led to road closures and evacuations in Pulga and Paradise, two unincorporated communities in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, about 170 miles north of San Francisco, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. At least 26,000 people have been ordered to evacuate, said Lynne Tolmachoff,  a spokeswoman for Cal Fire. The fire began in the Feather River Canyon and quickly expanded, pushed along by 40 mile-per-hour winds, she said. Fire advisories, known as red flag warnings, were issued for the area given extreme dryness and high winds.
